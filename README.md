# Cobot-Scrabble

The project aims to leverage computer vision, machine learning, and collaborative robots (cobot) to detect letters/alphabet characters, build a game logic, and control the movement of the cobot. The system utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect and recognize the letters/alphabet characters, and machine learning algorithms to classify them. The game logic is built around the detected letters/alphabet characters, and the cobot will be used to perform various movements and actions as part of the game. This project involves the integration of various hardware and software components, including the AI Camera KIT setup, cobots, and programming frameworks such as OpenCV, TensorFlow.
