# Cobot-Scrabble

The project aims to leverage computer vision, machine learning, and collaborative robots (cobot) to detect alphabets, build a game logic, and control the movement of the cobot. The cobot used is myCobot 320 M5 version robotic arms are jointly produced by Elephant Robotics and Shenzhen Mingzhan Technology Co., Ltd. - M5STACK. It boasts a 350mm working radius, with1000g payload, and 1mm repeatability. The system utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect and recognize the alphabet characters, and machine learning algorithms to classify them. The game logic is built around the detected alphabet characters, and the cobot will be used to perform various movements and actions as part of the game. This project involves the integration of various hardware and software components, including the AI Camera KIT setup, myCobot, and programming frameworks such as OpenCV, TensorFlow.
